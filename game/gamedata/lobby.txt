	"Ms. Render: Well students, let's end this class day with a story"
	"Froggy's Adventures By John Wisely"
	"Froggy's Adventures: Once upon a time there was a small pond, deep in the woods."
	"It was filled with fresh water and shaped like a perfect circle."
	"There were lily pads, grass, and endless bugs to eat."
	"This pond was home to a small frog named Harry."
	"He lived in this pond for his whole life and is a very happy frog." 
	"Everyday is the same for Harry."
	"He wakes up at 7:05 AM when the sun is high in the sky and gets ready for the day."
	"He eats some dragonflies that buzz around his home and takes a splash in the water."
	"Harry leaves his pond at 8:15 to meet his friend Becky."
	"Becky is a woodpecker who lives on a crooked tree deep in the woods."
	"She likes to sing every day and peck at his home."
	"Harry finds Becky a little strange but he is happy to be his friend."
	"As Harry meets Becky, Becky calls down and says "Hey there Harry, how are you today?""
	"Harry replies "I am well, just started my day""
	""Could you please eat these worms, they are filling up my holes" asks Becky"
	""I would be happy to" says Harry"
	"It was 11:24 and just in time for lunch."
	"There were worms everywhere and Harry understood Becky's problem"
	"Harry hopped from branch to branch, eating every worm in sight"
	"When he was done, Becky was smiling from ear to ear and thanked Harry again"
	"Harry said goodbye and left to meet his other neighbor at 1:45PM"
	"His other neighbor Susan, is just as strange as Becky"
	"She is a squirrel who loves to collect nuts that fall from the trees"
	"Nuts are really gross to eat, bugs are much tastier"
	"While hopping down the path, Harry looks around the area"
	"Many twigs have broken from the trees."
	"The sun has set halfway across the sky and the clouds are fluffy and white."
	"Harry is glad to live in these woods because they never change and are beautiful"
	"Its 3:52 and Harry finally reaches Susan, but sees she is upset"
	""What is wrong Susan, why are you sad" asks Harry"
	""One of my nuts fell down this well, and I can't reach it with my arms" replies Susan"
	"Harry looks down the well and spots the nut, it lays on a leaf three feet down."
	"After thinking about it, Harry comes up with an idea"
	""What if I extend my tongue to catch the nut for you?" suggests Harry"
	""That's an amazing idea!" responds Susan"
	"Harry puts his head in the well and aims for the leaf."
	"He misses the first time but tries again and succeeds."
	"Susan jumps for joy and is very happy to have her nut back"
	"Thank you so much Harry, you are the best frog in the world!"
	""I am happy to help you Susan" replies Harry"
	"As Susan runs away to add to her nut collection, Harry realizes how late it is."
	"Its already 5:30 and he begins his journey home"
	"He hops back to the pond as the sky turns dark"
	"Harry dips into the pond and eats a few more flies for dinner,"
	"Harry falls asleep at 9:15 with a smile on his face"
